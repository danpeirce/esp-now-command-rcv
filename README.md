# esp-now-control-rcv

The purpose of the modified sketch for receiving the control
information and adjusting the color and brightness of the RGB LED built onto an ESP-32 board.

In exploring the use of ESP NOW on a ESP32-S2-DEVKITC-1 board I found a simple example at 

* [https://dronebotworkshop.com/esp-now/#One-Way_Responder_Sketch](https://dronebotworkshop.com/esp-now/#One-Way_Responder_Sketch)

All the sketches on that page can be downloaded in a zip file if you go to the bottom of the page. The entire page contains useful 
information that I will not duplicate here.

I took the responder sketch and modified it to control the RGB LED on the ESP32. My modified control transmitter can be found at
